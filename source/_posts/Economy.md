### The Changing World Order 



The times ahead will be radically different from those that we've experienced in our lifetime, though similar to many times before.

How do I know that ? Because they always have been.

Over my roughly 50 years of global macroeconomic investing, I've learned the hard way that the most important events that surprised me did so because they never happened in my lifetime.

They had indeed happend many times before, with the ups and the downs of the Dutch British and US Empire, and every time they did, it was a sign of the changing world order.

In 1971, when I was a young clerk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the United States ran out of money and defaulted on its debts. That's right, the US ran out of money. How? Well, back then, gold was  the money used in transactions between countries. Paper money, like the dollar, was like checks in a check book, in that it had no value other than it could be exchange for gold, which was the real money. At the time, the United States was spending a lot more money of these paper money checks than it had gold in the bank to exchange for them. As people turn these checks into the bank for gold money, the amount of gold in the US started to dwindle. It soon became obvious that the US couldn't keep its promises for all the existing paper money, so people holding dollars rush to exchange them before the gold ran out. Recognizing that the US was going to run out of the real money. 

On Sunday evening, August 15, president Nixon went on television to tell the world that the US was breaking its promise to let people exchange their dollars for gold. He said it more diplomatically, without making it clear that the United States was default. "A strength of a nation's currency is based on the strength of that nation's economy, and the American economy is by far the strongest in the world. Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to take the action necessary to defend the dollar against the speculators.  I have directed Secretary Conly to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar in the gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the United States." I watched in awe, realizing that money as we understood it, was ending. What a crisis. I expected the stock market to plunge the next day, do I got on the exchange floor early to prepare when the opening bell rang.

The market was up, way up and went on to rise nearly 25%. That surprise me, because I never experienced a currency devaluation. When I dug into history, I discovered that the exact same thing happened in 1933 and had the exact same effect. 

Then paper dollars were also linked to gold, which the US was running out of, because it was spending more paper money checks then it had gold to exchange for them. And President Roosevelt announced on the radio that he would break the country's promise to exchange dollars for gold. 

"It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the National Bank holiday. And this was the 1st step in the government's reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric. The 2nd step, last Thursday was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the Congress, confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possible, in view of the requirement of time, to extend the holiday and lift the ban of the holiday gradually in the days to come. This law also gave authority into developing programs."

In both cases, breaking the link to gold allowed the US to continue spending more than it earned simply by printing more paper dollars. Since there was an increase in the number of dollars without an increase in the country's wealth, the value of each dollar fell.

As these new dollars entered the market, without a corresponding increase in productivity, they went to buy lots of stocks, golden commodities, and hence, caused their prices to rise. As I studied more history, I saw that the exact same thing happened many, many times before. I saw that since the beginning of time, when government spent much more than they took in in taxes, and conditions got bad, they ran out of money, and they needed more,  so they printed more, a lot more, which made its value for and made the prices of most everything, including stocks, gold and commodities rise. 

**That's when I 1st learned the principle that when central banks print a lot of money to relieve a crisis, buy stocks, gold and commodities, because their value will rise and the value of paper money will fall. This printing of money is also what happened in 2008 to relieve the mortgage driven debt crisis, and in 2020 to relieve the pandemic driven economic crisis. And it almost certainly will happen in the future. So I suggest that you keep this principle in mind.**

**These experiences gave me another principle, which is to understand what is coming at you, you need to understand what happened before you.**

That principle led me to study how the roaring twenties bubble turned into the 1930s Depression, which gave me the lessons that allowed me to anticipate and profit from the 2007 bubble turning into the 2008 bust. All these experiences led me to develop an almost instinctual urge to look to the past a similar situation, to learn how to handle the future. Well, changing orders.

Over the last few years, three big things that hadn't happened in my lifetime prompt wanted me to do this study. **1st**, countries didn't have enough money to pay their debts, even after lowering interest rate to zero, so their central banks began printing lots of money to do so. **2nd**, big internal conflicts emerged due to growing gaps in wealth and values.

This showed up in political populism and polarization between the left, who want to redistribute wealth, and the right, who want to defend those holding the wealth. And 3rd, increasing external conflict between a rising great power and the leading great power, as is now happening with China and the United States. So I looked back, I saw that all these had happened together before, many times, and nearly always led to changing domestic and world orders. The last time this sequence happened was from 1930 to 1945. 

What exactly is in order? You might ask. It's a governing system for people dealing with each other. There are internal orders for governing within countries, typically laid out in constitutions, and there is a world order for governing between countries, typically laid out in treaties.

Internal orders change at different times than world orders the weather within or between countries. These orders typically change after wars, civil wars within countries, international wars between countries. They happened when revolutionary new forces defeat weak old orders, eg. 

The US internal order was laid out in the constitution in 1789 after the American Revolution, and it is still operating today, even after the American Civil War. Russia got rid of its old daughter and established a new one with the Russian revolution in 1917, which ended in 1991 with a relatively bloodless revolution. In 1944, the New World Monetary System was laid out in the Breton Woods Agreement, and establish the dollar as the world leading reserve currency.
