### Diffusion Model

#### Application

- Stability AI's Stable Diffusion

- OpenAI's DALL-E(beginning with DALL-E-2)
- Midjourney
- Google's Imagen

They improve upon the performance and stability of other [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) architectures used for image synthesis such as [variational autoencoders (VAEs),](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/variational-autoencoder) generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoregressive models such as PixelCNN.

Diffusion models are most prominently associated with image generation and other image processing tasks such as inpainting and super-resolution, but their applications extend to other domains including audio generation, drug design and molecule generation. For simplicity, this article will focus on image generation.
